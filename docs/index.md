# PDOPT: Probabilistic Design space exploration and OPTimisation

A `python` framework for set-based design space exploration without explicit elimination rules. It impements a set-based approach for mapping the requirements on the design space, using a probabilistic surrogate model trained on the provided design model. This procedure ensures to identify the best candidate areas of the design space with the minimum number of assumptions of the design of the system.
